# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

This Python script demonstrates how to perform K-Means clustering for customer segmentation using the scikit-learn library. Customer segmentation is a technique to divide customers into groups based on their behavior, which can be useful for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Download the dataset 'Online Retail.csv' and place it in the same directory as this script.

2. Execute the script by running:

```bash
python customer_segmentation.py
```

3. The script will perform the following steps:

   - Data preprocessing, including removing duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (Amount) for each customer.
   - Standardization of the feature values using StandardScaler.
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow method.
   - Running K-Means clustering with the selected K value.
   - Visualizing the clusters using box plots.
   - Predicting the cluster for a new data point and calculating its distance to the cluster center.

4. The script outputs cluster labels for each customer, cluster visualization plots, and information about a new data point's cluster assignment.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following parameters:

- `n_clusters`: Number of clusters to create. Adjust this based on your desired segmentation.
- `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations for the K-Means algorithm.
- `new_data_point`: Specify a new data point to predict its cluster assignment and distance to the cluster center.

## Data

The script uses the 'Online Retail.csv' dataset. Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and includes necessary columns.

## Results

The script provides insights into customer segments based on their behavior and allows for targeted marketing strategies.

Please note that this README provides an overview of the script's functionality. For a detailed understanding of each step, refer to the code comments in the script itself.

Happy customer segmentation!
